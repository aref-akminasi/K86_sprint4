## Background

We had to work together in the final sprint of minor Visual design & Front end development 2021-2022 at The Hague university of applied sciences. The intention is that we build a showcase website where we demonstrate our work from the previous sprints. We have built a team together with a combination of developers and designers to enrich the best results.
